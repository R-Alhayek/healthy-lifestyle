  <section><p><h3>What is Food Labels?</h3></p>
   <p>Food labels can help you choose between products and keep a check on the amount of foods you're eating that are high in fat, salt and added sugars.

Most pre-packed foods have a food label on the back or side of the packaging.

These labels include information on energy in kilojoules (kJ) and kilocalories (kcal), usually referred to as calories.

They also include information on fat, saturates (saturated fat), carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt.

All nutrition information is provided per 100 grams and sometimes per portion of the food.</p></section>
 <section><p><h3>How to Read Food Labels?</h3></p>
  <p>According to a recent Nielsen report, almost 60-percent of consumers misinterpret or have a hard time comprehending nutrition labels.

One of the most critical parts of reading your food labels is to look at the serving size; 160 calories may not seem like much, but that could be for only two little cookies. Continue reading for other factors to keep in mind when grocery shopping for your healthy foods.

Saying “zero trans fat”, “all natural”, or “contains whole wheat” can trick you into thinking the product is healthy, even when its nutritional value has been stripped away after being processed.
Alternatively, many packaged products are packed with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. In other words, these claims make you forget about the added calories. Here is a list of what you should know before you read your food’s nutritional facts:
   <ul>
     <li>Sugar: Women should try to limit their sugar intake to 25 g / day or 6 teaspoons.</li>
     <li>Fat: There are about 9 calories per gram of fat - stick to about 50 g / day.</li>
     <li>Sodium: Women should not consume more than 1,500 mg or 3.8 g of salt / day.</li>
     <li>Protein: Women exercising less than 30 min / day should eat about 46 g of protein / day.</li>
     <li>Vitamins: Naturally occurring vitamins are ideal, but added vitamins can be helpful too.</li>
     <li>Calories: The average amount for women is 2,000 / day and 1,500 / day to lose weight based on a 150 lb.</li></ul></p>

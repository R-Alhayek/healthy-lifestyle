   <p>16/8 intermittent fasting is one of the most popular styles of fasting. Proponents claim that it’s an easy, convenient and sustainable way to lose weight and improve overall health. 16/8 intermittent fasting involves limiting consumption of foods and calorie-containing beverages to a set window of eight hours per day and abstaining from food for the remaining 16 hours.

  This cycle can be repeated as frequently as you like — from just once or twice per week to every day, depending on your personal preference.

  16/8 intermittent fasting has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, especially among those looking to lose weight and burn fat.

  While other diets often set strict rules and regulations, 16/8 intermittent fasting is easy to follow and can provide real results with minimal effort.

  It’s generally considered less restrictive and more flexible than many other diet plans and can easily fit into just about any lifestyle.

  In addition to enhancing weight loss, 16/8 intermittent fasting is also believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and enhance longevity.
